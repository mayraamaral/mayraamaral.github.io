# Simple and temporary profile page
This page is temporary, I'm using it while I build my main webpage and portfolio.  
  
This page was made using some useful content on the internet.  
I will put the content that helped me to build it linked here so I can get access to it in the future if I need.

I also used my [links](https://github.com/mayraamaral/links) source code and made some adaptations. The main code was based on [LittleLink](https://littlelink.io/).
